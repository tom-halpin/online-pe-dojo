    Thank you Miyagi for the overview. Let's take stock see where we are and agree on next steps.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    Sounds like a plan.

speaking: Pennyworth

    Following your overview, and the work Adriana is doing in InGen.

speaking: Pennyworth

    The team have an understanding of Design Thinking and how it might be used.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    We realize the impact it would have on the Ideation & Conceptualization and Architecture & Prototyping Product Engineering phases.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    As a team, we need to decide what to do next. How do we introduce Design Thinking to the group?
---
speaking: Brenda
text: >
    First, I think we need to agree on the model that we adapt.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Agreed, I think the Stanford model is best suited to our needs.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    If there are no objections, our first decision is to adopt the Stanford model.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    Then we need to prepare a communications strategy and some training materials.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    We have used KataCoda for interactive scenario based training in support of the Pet Clinic DevOps transformation.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    OK, then our second decision is to prepare a communications strategy and support it with a KataCoda course on Design Thinking.
---
speaking: Brenda
text: >
    We need to encourage early adopters.
---
speaking: Brenda
text: >
    Provide them with some coaching.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    Establish a Design Thinking community of practice within the group etc.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Excellent ideals all.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    We could and should apply the Stanford Design Thinking process in support of this rollout.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Of course, the empathize, define, ideate, prototype & test process will help us achieve our objectives.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Before we proceed, let's test some of those concepts by asking [student] some questions.
