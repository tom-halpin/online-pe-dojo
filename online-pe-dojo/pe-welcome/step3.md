Now that you have decided to take this course there is an optional challenge awaiting you.

The challenge is to take some time to consider and make some notes as to your current understanding of and on the use of Product Engineering in your team.

The ask is that you review and reflect on those notes upon completion of the **Online Product Engineering Dojo**.

Good luck with the challenge.
